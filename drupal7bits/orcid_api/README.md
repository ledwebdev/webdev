Drupal 7 Custom Block for ORCID API Support

This is a simple example of using the ORCID API for dynamically pulling content into a
Drupal block. The block looks for a field named _orcid_id_ in the loaded node and
uses values from _Configuration->System->ORCID Config_ for the _server_ and _token_ values.
